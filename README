# Prog 8 Machine Learning in Javascript

## Instalation

To install my project you need to clone the repository.
After you did that you need to go to the terminal and cd->server.

```bash
cd/Prog8/Server
```

When you are in the server folder you then need to download all the packages with npm.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Go back to the terminal and type this line below to start the server/

```bash
node --env-file=.env server.js
```

## What's Missing?

- CSS
- Server is only local and since you shouldn't upload an .env file it won't work
